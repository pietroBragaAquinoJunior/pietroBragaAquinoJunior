# About me

👋🏻 Hello, my name is **Piêtro** and I am a **web developer** 🌐.

👨🏻‍🎓 I have a degree in **Computer Engineering** from the State University of Maranhão 🏛️.

💻 I specialize in full stack development using **VueJS 3** 🇻 and **Spring Boot** 🍃.

🚀 My goal is to continue deepening my knowledge of **Java** ☕, **JavaScript** 🇯‌🇸, and **English** 🇺🇸.

📚 I put everything on github but I will only separate the projects that I believe are most relevant 🏅.
