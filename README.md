👋🏻 Hello, my name is Piêtro and I am a web developer 🌐.

👨🏻‍🎓 I have a degree in Computer Engineering from the State University of Maranhão 🏛️.

💻 I specialize in full stack development using VueJS 3 🇻 and Spring Boot 🍃.

🚀 My goal is to continue deepening my knowledge of Java ☕, JavaScript 🇯‌🇸, and English 🇺🇸.

📚 I put everything on github but I will only separate the projects that I believe are most relevant 🏅.
